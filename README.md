# Instructions
You will need to create a private copy of this repository on your GitHub account.

To do this:
- Clone the repository on your device
- Create a *new empty private* repository on your own account
- In your cloned version, remove the old remote origin and set it to your new repository. The commands to do this will be shown to you after you create the new repo, and will look something like this: 
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/USER_NAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
- Ensure that the files are visible on your repository, and ensure the commit history is maintained. You can view the commit history by clicking on the *X Commits* right under the Code button, or by going to `https://github.com/USER_NAME/REPO_NAME/commits/main/`.
